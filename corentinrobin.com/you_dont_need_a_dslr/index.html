		<h1>YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED A DSLR.</h1>

		<p><i>Author: Corentin ROBIN ; corentin.robin@gmail.com</i></p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<div>As an amateur photographer for almost 4 years, I've been using a DSLR<sup>(1)</sup> all the time.</div>
		<div>Then I noticed that a lot of picture I took and I really liked were taken with my phone, and I noticed that I didn't take my gear with me as much as before.</div>
		<div>So I decided to go on the Internet and look for alternatives, and discovered that compact cameras nowadays give equal result (image quality wise) to DSLRs.</div>
		<div>So I bought one<sup>(2)</sup> and started to use it almost daily (super convenient as it fits in my pocket).</div>
		<div>For my test, the only differences I noticed were a loss of sharpness in the corners of the pictures, and slightly less details when zooming in on my computer, issues I didn't have with my DSLR, but looking both identical on full screen (13" retina display).</div>

		<div>So the question is: as the pictures looks exactly the same, and if you don't have to sell or give massive prints, why on Earth would you buy a DSLR?</div>

		<div>(Note that given the retina display pixel density, if it looks good on it, you can definitely print it, no problems.)</div>

		<h2>People who need high-end gear</h2>

		<h3>Wildlife photographer</h3>

		<div>A wildlife photographer <b>needs</b> a long focal length, to avoid scaring animals and make them run away.</div>
		<div>He <b>needs</b> a big aperture and a big sensor, as he will be often working in low light condition (often in woodlands).</div>

		<div>See: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MortenHilmer" target="_blank">Morten Hilmer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Vincent+Munier" target="_blank">Vincent Munier</a></div>

		<h3>Sport photographer</h3>

		<div>He needs a high shutter speed, so a big aperture took capture as much light as possible during this short exposure.</div>
		<div>He needs a long focal length, because the action is far away (tennisman, football player, F1 car)</div>

		<h3>Landscape photographer</h3>

		<div>He will need a good optical quality and a big sensor if he want to sell prints for example.</div>

		<div>See: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfhW84xfA6gEc4hDK90rR1Q" target="_blank">Thomas Heaton</a></div>

		<h3>Reportage photographer</h3>

		<div>He will need a big aperture and a big sensor if he wants to be able to capture any action at any time of the day, he will be often in low light conditions.</div>

		<h2>Us, the amateurs</h2>

		<div>In my personal experience, I can take whatever shot in whatever condition, my 1" sensor is enough in low light condition, and the 25 to 250mm is way enough to frame whatever scene I want.</div>
		<div>And if I want to record something, it can record 4K as well.</div>
		<div>This kind of camera costs around 450€ in 2021, the equivalent in DSLR costs around 800€ (body + zoom lens).</div>

		<div>I concluded that I didn't need a DSLR anymore, and you probably don't either.</div>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		<div>I think 90% of amateur photographers don't need a DSLR, and I think in 2021 we can even do photography only with <a href="https://www.photographyblog.com/previews/apple_iphone_12_pro_photos" target="_blank">a phone</a> (you will have only a limited zoom though).</div>
		<div>Most of people having a full frame camera will post their images only on Instagram, and those pictures will be watched mostly from a phone...</div>
		<div>Note that most of medium range compact cameras and some recent phones allow you to shoot RAW.</div>

		<div>Note the relatively low shutter speed and high ISO, handheld, managed perfectly by the built-in stabilizer.</div>
